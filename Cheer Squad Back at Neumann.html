                    I can&#8217;t even remember the last time Neumann had a cheer team. But now, we have a devoted team made up of high schoolers, middle schoolers, and even some kids from elementary school. They had a pretty great season, showing off their Neumann pride by showing their support for our varsity basketball teams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I interviewed a couple of our high school cheerleaders about their experience on this years&#8217; team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know we were gonna have a cheer team at first, but I honestly joined just to try it,&#8221; sophomore Emiley Moyle said. &#8220;But I really enjoyed being with my fellow teammates and learning a lot about my communication skills.&#8221;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I then interviewed another high school cheerleader, about her experiences on the cheer team. &#8220;I joined because I love cheer and it's something I enjoy doing,&#8221; sophomore Nivea Sweeting said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want the season to end because it's been really fun teaching the little kids and doing something I love.&#8221;.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From what I&#8217;ve heard, all of the cheerleaders made new friends, special memories, and a great squad. We hope to continue the cheer team for years to come.
