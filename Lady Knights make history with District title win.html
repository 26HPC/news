                    Neumann lost last year after a 13 point lead in the 3rd quarter but they learned and fought back this year to win it all. The Knights will face off against High Point Baptist this Saturday, March 9th at 7:30 p.m. at the Catholic Community Center at St. John Neumann High School.

                    The boy&#8217;s team lost a thrilling game 49-48 to the Muncy Indians last Wednesday night for the District Championship, but will still compete in state&#8217;s. The Knights tried to take back a victory after losing to Muncy in the district championship last year.
