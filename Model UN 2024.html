                    This year at Neumann, our Model UN club found themselves at the Field House at Penn College. Our three teams had the countries of Mexico, New Zealand, and India. The preparation was exciting, doing lots of research to learn about these new countries&#39; current events, and getting to understand someplace that we may not call home. Unfortunately, in the morning session this year, none of our teams&#39; resolutions were passed. Everyone still had a fun time voting and getting the government experience, helping to pass resolutions.

                    The following students won the <i>Superior Delegate</i> awards at Model UN this year: Harrison Carnicom, Avery Androvette, Emma Gallew, Lucas Bower, and Josh Lovell.

                    As a first time Model UN member, I definitely learned a lot and really enjoyed my experience, and I believe everyone else did as well. For next year&#39;s reference, if you even have the slightest interest in current events in our world, Model UN is definitely something you should consider trying! Even if you least expect it, you might end up loving it. I know I did!
