                    National Honors Society one of the second oldest student organizations in the country, having been founded in 1921, second only to Phi Beta Kappa. Despite its clear Pennsylvanian origin, as their seal uses the Pennsylvanian keystone symbol, it is active in the entire country, with 1.4 million members globally.

                    The Ceremony took place in Our Lady of Lourdes Parish. After all of the inductees had said the pledge to uphold the values of the National Honors society, they all received their certificates. These values are scholarship, character, leadership, and service.

                    Following the ceremony, NHS members, old and new, went to get ice cream. It was raining and the pavilion didn&#39;t have a roof for some reason, but the delicious ice cream made up for that.
