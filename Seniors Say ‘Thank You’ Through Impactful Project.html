                    During Catholic Schools Week, each member of the Senior class of 2024 surprised a member of faculty, staff, or Neumann community figures who’ve made a specific impact on them.

                    Each senior gifted their nominee with a shirt that said “I Made An Impact” with each graduate’s last name on the back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The nominees included teachers and athletic faculty representing various subjects and sports.
