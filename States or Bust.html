                    Coming into a new season, a fresh Neumann boy&#39;s baseball team has adopted a new slogan, wearing bracelets that have a motivating message: <i>States Or Bust</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although the boys are 4 and 6 so far this season, the team is still hopeful for a deep playoff run.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Neumann team has four freshmen and two transfers into the program, leaving senior and captain of the team Aidan Vogt feeling optimistic about the team&#39;s future.

                    &#8220;Last year was a down year for us so this year was big for us,&#8221; Vogt said. &#8220;We knew it would be a good year with good pitching coming up and we knew we&#39;d have a good lineup so we knew that this year was our chance to make a deep run in the playoffs.&#8221;
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the time of this interview, Neumann was 1 and 2. When asked about the season so far, Vogt was hopeful and confident that they&#39;d continue to play hard despite losses to difficult teams to beat.

                <p>
                    &#8220;We&#39;re playing tough,&#8221; Vogt said. &#8220;We played two good teams this week. We started off rough against Bucktail, but we got a win though. We&#39;ve got some tough ones coming up, but we should be able to bang it out.&#8221;
                </p>
