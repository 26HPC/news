                    Some Civics classes visited Pennsylvania College of Technology to become senators for a day.

                <p>
                    The trip was part of a student government seminar put on by Senator Gene Yaw.

                    Students arrived at the Penn Tech field house for breakfast and a presentation, then were split off into committees. Each committee was assigned a bill, which they would amend and vote on with the help of various supervisors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some bills were based on real life examples, while others were made for the seminar. There were bills about gun rights, marijuana legalization, bullying, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After all bills had been voted on, students would meet back up and vote again as a whole body on those proposed laws that had passed in committee. This seminar was supposed to be an accurate representation of how United States senators spend their day in Congress.

                    &#8220;The goal was to educate students about the legislative process and have them actively participate in a simulated session of the PA state senate,&#8221; Mr. Richards, who took some Civics students on the trip, said. &#8220;They learned about the steps of the legislative process and all the factors that lawmakers need to consider when making decisions on potential laws.&#8221;
