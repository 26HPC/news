                    <b>1. What do you like to do in your free time?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like doing genealogy research. I like learning about where my family came from and how I am here where I am today.

                    <b>2. What's the biggest challenge in the classroom and how do you overcome it?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The biggest challenge in my classroom is students talking. I overcome this by creating activities that include talking to each other.

                    <b>3. What's your favorite topic to teach?</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to teach how our government works because I like showing students how to get involved with their community. I also want them to know that they can change the world.
