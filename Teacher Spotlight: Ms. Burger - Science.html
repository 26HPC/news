                    I like spending time with my family and friends. We go on hikes/walks, kayaking, and we go to baseball games. My favorite baseball team is the Phillies. The first ever Major League Baseball game that I went to was a Phillies game.

                <p>
                    The biggest challenge in my classroom is not having enough time for everything. I overcame this because I have excellent time management skills.
